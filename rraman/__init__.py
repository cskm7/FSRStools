Resonance Raman excitation profile calculation based on the time-domain picture of resonance Raman. See Myers and Mathies in *Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy*, Vol. 2, pp. 1-58 (John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1987) for details (referred to as Myers in the following). The code is mainly based on Myers' Fortran 77 code (see Appendix of PhD Thesis of K. M. Spillane, 2011, UC Berkeley for source code).

**Changelog:**

*10-7-2015:*

   - Added / modified functions for calculating fluorescence spectra.
   - Added a convenience function to calculate Raman spectra from a set of excitation profiles.
   - Added some more damping functions and phenomenological support for Stokes shift in simple homogeneous damping function.


**Example Code**

Here is a short example calculating Myers' *Gedankenmolecule* from Myers and Mathies::

    ialpha = 1

    # electronic transition dipole length
    M = 0.8

    # index of refraction of surrounding medium
    IOR = 1.0

    # time axis parameters for integrations
    tmax = 5000
    dt = 0.2

    # just calculate fundamentals
    nquanta = np.identity(len(RMg))
    sshift = np.dot(nquanta, RMg)

    # calculation part
    # ----------------
    # create axes
    t, wn = rr.getAxes(tmax, dt)

    # zero-zero energy and damping
    # add here all time domain stuff
    TDpart = rr.getHomogeneousDamping(t, Gamma, halpha)

    # time dependent overlap integrals
    OVLPS = rr.getOverlaps(t, D, RMg, RMe, nquanta)

    # calculate cross-sections
    sigmaA, sigmaR, kF = rr.getCrossSections(t, wn, E0, OVLPS, sshift, M, IOR, TDpart, sig, ialpha)
