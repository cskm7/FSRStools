Class :py:class:`Layer`
-----------------------

Each layer is represented by an instance of the :py:class:`Layer` class. This class holds all the physical parameters like thickness, dielectric tensor and orientation.

Class :py:class:`System`
------------------------

The :py:class:`System` class represents the optical system whose reflection and transmission coefficients are to be calculated. It manages the layer stacking and the external physical properties like wavelength and angle of incidence.

An optical system consists of the first (semi-infinite) layer (substrate), the intermediate layers and the last (semi-infinite) layer (superstrate). The *superstrate* is assumed to be **isotropic** and only the xx component of the dielectric tensor is used for the calculation of the in-plane (x, y) propagation constants.

Needle Algorithm
----------------

The following functions provide support for the so-called needle algorithm for automated design of dielectric / metallic multilayer components.
The algorithm is a simplified version based on Sullivan and Dobrowolski, *Appl. Opt.* **35**, 5484 (1996).
Given a set of target optical properties and an initial system class with at least one optical layer, the needle algorithm tries to optimize the
design by varying the thickness of each layer followed by insertion of a very thin layer with different refractive index.
Currently, the design can only be optimized for one of the following properties: Rxx, Rxy, Ryx, Ryy, Txx, Txy, Tyx, Tyy.
